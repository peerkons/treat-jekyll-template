Wussup guys, w/oBS here.

Ever sit your ass down on Reddit and notice that a bodybuilding/fitness/steroid/weightlifting/whatever subreddit reaches the front page? Well, when it happens from time to time, the outcome always is the same. 9Gaggers who sit their asses in the front page ready their fingers for some quality trolling, while gym social justice warriors put down their dumbbells to prepare for a counterattack. The reason why stupid shit happens is because behind the protection of a computer screen everybody feels mighty and capable of giving out a punch. Most recently, a similar post reached r/whitepeoplegifs and now r/wtf -

https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/66x9mj/nice_set_xpost_from_rwhitepeoplegifs/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=WTF

Now, let's examine this specimen - basically we can see the world record holder in benchpress in the under 66kg (If I recall correctly) category lifting the bar a couple of inches. The reason why I hate the normies in r/all is because these know-it-alls who have never stepped their foot in the gym start criticizing the dude's form. Of course, do I believe that stuff like this should be allowed in powerlifting? Probably not, but I am just a dude who lifts and not a powerlifter. Furthermore, in every sport, people will find ways to bend the rules to their favor. This has happened since the early days of each sport and will continue happening. Anyways, this is not even what I wanted to rant about, but this stuff has been on my mind lately, so whatever.&nbsp;

The real shit I wanted to rant about is the featured image of the post. This is a legit Google and I remember I had done this about half a year ago. Basically it is the Fitness industry, where people who are on steroids supposedly have never ran a cycle, and people who touch a dumbbell the first time believe that after a couple of years of Rice, Chicken, Creatine, and Hard Work they too can become the next Olympia competitor.&nbsp;

People like https://www.instagram.com/simeonpanda/?hl=en and https://www.instagram.com/dontefranklin91/?hl=en who put up the "x years of training" or "lifetime natural" are a fucking cancer to growth of the sport of bodybuilding. Of course, Donte is a fucking troll, but to the uneducated r/fitness wannabe he still might be a natural idol. The problem is that:

1) Steroids are illegal in most places;

2) Steroids are a must for staying competitive outside of instagram.

See, the reason why this causes a problem, is because to get normal money and a following as a fitness persona on the internet, you need to do one of the following things - 1) Start competing fucking well; 2) Start your own fitness company; 3) Join a fitness company. You see, the problem with points one and three is that without gear you can't stay competitive in a field where everyone is on it, and three - if you join such companies, you most likely are on gear, but can't say it because it does not set a healthy image for the company (you show the people that the gear, not the supplements make the physique). Then there is the second point - guys like Rich Piana who are open to steroid use are very minimal (can't lose a job if you are the boss), but still stating that you are using illegal drugs on the internet can cause plenty of problems. This again leads to people either staying quiet of their use/saying they are natural, while promoting testosterone boosters.&nbsp;

People who are not interested with lifting much/nutrition, probably don't know much about steroids, and from there on they see guys like Ronnie Coleman promoting their whey and thinking that after a couple of years they can be massive. As we can see in the featured image of this post, a simple google of "Natural bodybuilder" shows like maybe 1 or 2 actually natural bodybuilders. We have fucking Dennis Wolf, Panda, and fucking Arnie (who has said even that he ain't no fucking natty (as if it wasn't obvious already)). The general public believes that a very very small part of the population is on steroids and those are probably the Open Olympia competitors - Phil Heath, etc. Most people think that Men's Physique competitors, and maybe even classic physique competitors are natural. Hey, many people probably think that women's physique competitors are just chicks who eat a lot and lift weights (\*eww, lifting weights makes me masculine\*).

What happens next, is that those who do find out that their dreams are crushed and they will never naturally be 140kg =, 6% mass monsters start taking everything they can get their hands on without actual knowledge. Why do we have sex education (shitty one, but some nonetheless), some education about smoking/recreational drugs, but none about steroids that would be offered for the general public? Personally speaking, I plan on hopping on in the next 5 years maybe, but only after I know everything inside-out, have perfected my mindset regarding dieting, and am financially stable (although this ain't much of a pre-requisite, as it ain't that expensive). Before I started reading about the topic myself, I didn't know how many people in my gyms are obvious steroid users.&nbsp;

Is there a cure for this cancer? Well, without steroids being legalised, I doubt much can change. The political system must be aware of everything and offer help. Why are women screaming about unrealistic body images, when a billboard shows a chick who has lifted for 6 months, but noone screams, that next to the chick is a dude who has definitely been on for more than a cycle?&nbsp;

My belief is that awareness must be raised and steroids must be legal. Education is key to reducing the people who harm themselves using the drugs. Will more people use them then? Yes, definitely. Will more people hurt themselves? Quite probably, as the general amount of users will increase by a lot, which, while reducing the percentage of people hurting themselves, will probably increase the total amount of people hurting themselves. But if we look at it this way - why is then smoking legal? Why is alcohol legal? (alcohol is probably more harmful in the long term than drug usage) People will always find ways to hurt themselves. Yes, increased accessibility will improve this rate, but it will also put the public eyes on gear suppliers, making the businesses less shady, if the government would regulate them more. Now, you never know if the gear is or isn't bunk, when ordering. This is because everything is hidden from the government, just to stay afloat.&nbsp;

I believe that legalization would:

1)Increase the amount of users, definitely;

2)Reduce controversy;

3)Raise general awareness;

4)Cause more studies to be made - making them more safe, allowing for more testing;

5)Increase people getting hurt (probably);

6)Allow users to step out of the closet, no more fucked up views;

7)Offer information more readily available for a less tech-savvy internet user;

8)Increase overall gear quality.

This is my personal view on the industry and gear. As I said, I have nothing against it, as I plan on using myself in the future (at least currently). For some quality read ups about roids, I recommend reading the following sources:

1) Reddit Steroids Wiki

2)r/bodybuilding | r/steroids | r/steroidsourcetalk

3) One of reddit user's blog - bodymaxing.com

4) BOOKS (Just google around :) )

May your gains come quick, w/oBS out.
