Wussup guys, w/oBS here.

So I am in no way an expert in the field of marketing, but it is sort of the shit I like, and Im frequently reading about different topics, mostly digital marketing - content editing, SEO, AdWords, analytics, etc. Anyways, I have started to look for a job in the field now, and from talking to people around me who have already established themselves in a good position in the department of large companies, it makes me feel sad about the many companies. Like how the fuck can you be an international company with a fuckton of millions in sales, but budget zero fucking dollars for your companies' marketing. Like what the fuck?

I understand that they have themselves structured very hierarchically and the average employee's age is over fucking nine thousand, but if you are a large company, you should be following all the trends in the industry and improving in the tech aspect. Come the fuck on, if you don't have at least tech savvy people on your team, your business will become prehistoric sooner or later.
