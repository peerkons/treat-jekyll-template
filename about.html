<div class="editable"><h1>What is this shit?</h1><p>You might ask - what the fuck is this crappy site with a random line next to the name. Well, here's the deal. The crappy line is the logo of this site. Why? Well, I ain't gonna bullshit you much about it. I wanted something bold for a logo, and realised that making fancy crap just to look good is overrated. I wanted something simple... something straight to the point. You know what is straight? A fucking line! So this is the answer to the question about the mysterious line, so now I can continue about the site. I am a business student with a passion for writing nonsense/bullshit and I have obviously too much leisure time available to be able to make up shit like the page you are visiting. You see, other than my will to just create something and write nonsense, I have noticed that with the increase in availability of the internet, a helluva lot of internet trolls have born. This causes a shitton of bullshit being spread over the millions of webpages seen through our lord and saviour Google. Other than that, the news likes to rant about fake stuff, so hey, why not read some genuine stuff from an uneducated know-it-all, who loves lifting, marketing, and sitting on his ass all day long. How do you know that this shit is genuine and not just a lousy clickbait? Well, I won't post about anything that I do not know about and the statistical/scientific/stupid-ass-complicated stuff will get references the shit out of it. This is withoutbullshit.xyz and you are in for an awesome ride through a blog that saves your time and doesn't feed you bullshit that you want to hear, but the real shit that you need to hear.</p><p><img alt="Jane Doe" src="https://source.unsplash.com/hHcHf4mOFgk" /></p></div>
